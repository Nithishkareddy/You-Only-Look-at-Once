This script performs object detection on an input image using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. It reads the image, YOLO configuration, weights, and class names from specified file paths, then processes the image to detect objects by creating a blob and forwarding it through the YOLO neural network. The detected objects are identified with bounding boxes and class labels, which are drawn on the image. The processed image is displayed and saved as object-detection.jpg. This script requires OpenCV, NumPy, and argparse libraries, and it can be executed from the command line by specifying the paths to the image, YOLO configuration, weights, and class names files.
